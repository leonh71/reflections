How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It allowed me to see changes introduced since my last save.


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

You will be able to track your incremental changes.


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Some systems allow for interconnected files, while for others this is not an issue.


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

“git log” will show a list of commits, while “git diff” will allow you to see the differences between 2 commits.


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

A programmer can always go back to a prior version that was working properly.


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I want to use Git to manage my changes.
