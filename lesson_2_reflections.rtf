What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?\
\
When you initialize a repository, metadata is created that helps Git track changes.\

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?\
\
The staging area holds files to be put into the repository.\
\
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?\
\
Make sure you clear the staging area before committing.\
\
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?\
\
In situations when you want to experiment and test different designs, branches can help you stay organized.\
\
How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?\
\
We can see the parents as well as the point in code development when the branches split off.\
