What would be a reason to push files to GitHub?

  
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A clone is simply a copy of a repository.  Once the clone take place, there is no relationship between the original and the clone.
A fork is a copy of a repository, from someones elseâ€™s GitHub account to yours.
A branch is a logical departure from the progressions recorded in the repository.
